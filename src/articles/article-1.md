2.Never encourage Tax fee as a percentage of tax refund.

Avoid preparers who base fees on a percentage of the refund or who boast bigger refunds than their competition. When asking about a preparer’s services and fees, don’t give them tax documents, Social Security numbers or other information. 

3.Choose a professional tax preparer who is willing to electronically file (E-File) the completed tax return return.

4.Provide records and receipts when requested by your tax preparer.

Good preparers will ask to see a taxpayer’s records and receipts. They’ll ask questions to figure things like the total income, tax deductions and credits.

5.Do not sign a blank tax return.

6.Review the return before signing.

7.Make sure that your tax preparer provides his/her Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN) in his tax return.
